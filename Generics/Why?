We can implement Stac using object type to use it as generic(accept any type value)
Disadvantage:boxing,unboxing and performance.Error porne
Stack stack = new Stack();
stack.Push(1);
//This compiles, but is not type safe, and will throw an exception: 
string number = (string)stack.Pop();

the above code is compiled but will give run time error.

Other Way:implement seprate stac for each type :IntStac,strinStac
Disadvantage:
repeatetive,low productivity ,if changes- change more than one place

Using Genrics:
